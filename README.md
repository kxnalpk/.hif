> Why am i creating this?
I wanted to create my own image format since I was 12 years old using Windows 7, tryna modify GTA San Andreas. That day, when I was finding stupid images from the internet to modify the existing images in the game, I wondered about those image file formats. Now 4.9 years later, I am creating my own file format just for fun!

> Should you use this?
I do not prefer using it since it's way too juicy and has nothing special but if you want to then sure! I will be updating this frequently to make it a decent file format. Thank you for reading <3
